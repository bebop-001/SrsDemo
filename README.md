The software implemnts:
 * a row of 5 "Assurance level" buttons that represent how sure
   you are of your answer: 1 being no knowledge and 5 being
   completely sure.
 * a TextView showing the state of the SRS Object's internal variables
 * a ListView that shows the state of the progressive changes to the
   state so you can see the results of pressing the different assurance
   levels.
